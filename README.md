        * unanswered 
        
               Because I don't have sufficient experience in SW arquitecture. 
               And I think, the better aproach in any project is to have a team 
               with some SW arquitect/team leader, programmers, scrummaster and 
               of course some DevOps. (that's my personal opinion) 

3. **Fundamentals Questions**

    * Q1..Q10 -> file other_answers.txt
